### Scientific background
I am a dedicated Conservation scientist that studied Biology, with expertise in Botany and Conservation Biology, from the University of La Laguna (Canary Islands). I hold a Master's degree in Conservation Biology and I am currently pursuing a PhD in *ex situ* conservation of threatened endemic species from the Macaronesia region.

I have made significant contributions to conservation research, with publications in four scientific articles and five book chapters related to a red list of threatened species from Macaronesia. Some of my relevant publications are:
* _Characterization of ten polymorphic microsatellite loci for the threatened species *Grimmia curviseta* Bouman (Grimmiaceae, Musci)_ (<https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03736687.2016.1183331>)
* _*Gymnostomiella* (Pottiaceae, Bryophyta) revisited: new insights revealed by a morphometric analysis_ (<https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=aFMOnrEAAAAJ&citation_for_view=aFMOnrEAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C>)
* _New bryophyte records from Macaronesia (<https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=aFMOnrEAAAAJ&citation_for_view=aFMOnrEAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C>)

### Work experience
I gained invaluable experience during a research stay at the Natural History Museum of London in 2015 (<https://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/departments-and-staff/life-sciences.html>), focusing on *in vitro* cultivation techniques for plant reintroduction.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I actively collaborated with national parks and contributed to some of their biodiversity conservation programs. I currently work as a Senior Science Technician in London, where I transmit my knowledge to the younger generation while continuing to prepare for my own future goals.

### My vision
Driven by my passion for Conservation Biology and Climate Change, I aspire to become a software and AI engineer dedicated to acquiring AI knowledge for research purposes. I am deeply fascinated by the potential of AI to revolutionise various fields and I am committed to contributing to its progress. By pursuing a career in software engineering, I aim to sharpen my technical skills and develop innovative solutions that leverage AI technologies. My ultimate goal is to play a pivotal role in pushing the boundaries of research using AI and ultimately contribute to solving complex real-world problems and improving the lives of people around the world. 

Through my multifaceted journey as a scientist, educator, and advocate, I remain resolute in inspiring positive change and empowering others to join the journey towards a thriving and biodiverse planet.
